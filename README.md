## About me 
  
Hi. My name is Jez. I am a teacher. I have been a teacher for 30 years. And now it's time for something a bit different.   

I play banjo too.

## What is this page?   
This is my reading notes for the full stack bootcamp.   

## Growth mindset
Growth mindset is most easily defined as the opposite of fixed mindset.   
**Fixed mindset** is where you believe that talent/intelligence is innate and cannot be changed. "There is no point trying. I cannot do this. I don't have the intelligence that others have."
**Growth mindset** believes that your brain is alomst infinitely plastic - it can change as you learn. But this is not easy nor even always comfortable, even though we are programmed to learn from birth. And this can lead some to a fixed mindset.
It's not infinite, of course. And innate talents do exist, particularly in physical attributes. But we can change, if we are willing to learn.

> The hallmark of successful people is that they are always stretching themselves to learn new things. You don't know what your abilities are until you make a full commitment to developing them. **Carol Dweck**
