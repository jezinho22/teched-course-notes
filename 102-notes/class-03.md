## Commands for git

Main thing is A - C - P:  **add - commit - push**  
Add to git. Commit changes to git. Push to git*hub*.
+ *git clone* & *https ...* - to add repository from github online to local machine
+ *cd* into new dir   
+ *git remote -v* - you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.  
+ *git add* & filename - to get ready to commit  
+ *git commit* & filename (or & . for all files that are waiting) - to commit and don't forget to add a message using *-m "  "* Sometimes it can be good to add and commit separately, with different messages for different files eg css, html, js for same project

+ *git push* - send changes up to cloud (eg if work was on VS on desktop)
+ *git pull* - bring changes from cloud (eg if work was on github online) 

+ *git push origin main* - This command pushes changes from the local “master” branch to the remote repository named “origin”. For cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local repository. However, these names can be changed by the user.

Also linux commands    
+ *touch* - to create file  ... & filename
+ *cd* - change dir
+ *cd ..* - to parent dir
+ *ls* - to list contents - dir also does this
+ *mkdir* - to create dir
+ *cd ~* - to go to root dir


Sometimes if I have been wandering around a bit randomly online and on desktop, I may have to merge files that have been changed both locally and remotely.  

I also found some cheat sheets with commands:

It's like working with remote docs locally and having changes save auto. Well, more like when you work on a 365 doc locally without internet connection. There can be clashes between two versions. *This* process allows you to make a copy, track changes on it, save it locally, save it remotely and track changes remotely. So you always have the most up-to-date version in github, and you know the most recent changes made, as well as what needs doing next if you like. This can be shared by collaborators.
