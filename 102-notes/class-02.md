## Choosing a text editor    

When I did this I just wanted something free and easy. Lighttable seemed like it would be, but there was too little support. A good thing was the integral browser window to run code in. But it was hard to run between files and in particular I could not access the console. Plus the extra stuff was not great because it is designed as a super lightweight editor. I need more support, though other editors do have a load of stuff I do not understand, use or probably need, which was also an appeal of Lighttable.

Reading recommends:    
1.) code completion;   
2.) syntax highlighting - colour-codes the code into parts of speech: eg variables, methods etc;   
3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and    
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them - these make jobs easier (but mostly only when you know what you are doing, I think.      
For me 1 and 2 are most important, then 3, and maybe in future some time, 4.

Apparently Emmet is useful for making code tidy. 

The reading goes on to discuss text editors like notepad etc. This isn't what I want. Experience has told me I want an IDE - all the text features from above, plus the ability to debug as I go - I do a lot of debugging when I have to problem-solve snippets of code.

VS Code looks like the best. I already use it. So ...
It all 4 features above, plus Emmet. And it has been integrated with github somehow, as a replacement for Atom.

I also tried Atom, but when I went to download it, there were messages saying it has been discontinued. It was OK when I used it for Python, but other stuff was much better. I used Spyder and Jupyter. Jupyter allows you to run chunks of code without the whole thing, and run code chunk by chunk which was really good for data work; also you can annotate clearly both for others and yourself. It was my favourite.
