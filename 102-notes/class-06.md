# Javascript

## Thoughts

I know about JS. How to use it to manipulate page elements, create functions, manage data. I am interested in how it creates and uses objects. It's very flexible. In my current project I have some data stored in objects, and I've started to think about how to add methods and call them - I know how to but not when to, or even whether to.

I don't know about server side or json and data. And that's what I need to learn.

TIL:

- The browser helps with debugging. It has a console, so you can put console.log() into html or js and load pages into the browser, and see what is logged to console. I have been using an IDE console, and been frustrated when I couldn't.
- I also didn't know that script will log to browser without being called as a function from the .js - that would have helped before!
- You can put javascript straight in the browser console, not sure how much yet.
- The browser can also help with CSS - it has a css window so you can see what css is being applied to page elements.
- JS variables I already knew about. Still not completely sure about scope but that hasn't come up in reading yet. I like how flexible they are - you don't get type errors.
- You can use prompt and confirm as input methods - <span style="color: #07E607">x = prompt("What's your name?", "Type name here")</span>
- Dot notation vs bracket notation - dot whenever you can; brackets when there's spaces in the property/method, or when you want to use a variable to pass the method.

JS is much more flexible than other languages I have used - objects can be changed, nested, copied, even created dynamically; datatypes barely matter. I want to read more about [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics).
