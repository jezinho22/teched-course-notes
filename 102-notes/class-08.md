## Assignment variables

So I knew = and ++, for instance. I expected +=

**TIL**

- I pray I never have to use left and right shift - yikes, binary
- Having said that bitwise AND etc look really cool - comparing binaries
- Nothing new in comparator operators
- Nor in arithmetic operators
- Ended up using || and && though or / and

**IWTFO**

- More about truthy and falsy - it seems like a by-product of js being so relaxed about datatypes
- Strict and sloppy modes - it's quite neat that js can anticipate the sharks we create beneath the surface but I don't understand many of them yet
- I need to brush up on logic some time - AND, OR, NOT - I do know it, and can work it out, but it can be disorientating

## Loops

Repetition is a computer super-power. They never get bored. They never give up. They can repeat and repeat, and do it really quickly.  
Nothing new in loops for me. Have to remember that js loops are different from VB or python, but I knew this.

**TIL**

- Loops are conistent with other parts of js - conditions/inputs in brackets, actions in curly brackets
- Goto is still sometimes needed (going old-skool) - in the form of breaks and labels to exit loops
- I like for ... in - it's succinct and it means you go exactly through all the contents until they are done
- I should have been using i for all my _for_ loops; but as I used index+Thing instead I think I can forgive myself - I went semantic; it's ok to repeatedly declare variables as for loop iterators

**IWTFO**

- How to use break, label, continue - but maybe best when I actually need to
- Which to use and when - especially for ... in, which doesn't always work for me so far  
  _An answer!: While loops tend to be useful when waiting for user input to change something or do what you want; For loops allow you to go through cycles you already know the length of, or the length will be decided in runtime_
