## Assignment variables

So I knew = and ++, for instance. I expected +=

**TIL**  
+ I pray I never have to use left and right shift - yikes, binary
+ Having said that bitwise AND etc look really cool - comparing binaries
+ Nothing new in comparator operators
+ Nor in arithmetic operators

**IWTFO**  
+ More about truthy and falsy - it seems like a by-product of js being so relaxed about datatypes
+ Strict and sloppy modes - it's quite neat that js can anticipate the sharks we create beneath the surface but I don't understand many of them yet
+ I need to brush up on logic some time - AND, OR, NOT - I do know it, and can work it out, but it can be disorientating
