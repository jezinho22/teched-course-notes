## Class 04 - HTML

I have used html before but not realised how useful semantic tags are.
I learned to make an image into a link by putting the img inside an anchor.

My pages will be more readable now and I have already re-written one.
Also never used wireframes before. It is a new idea to be organising the structure and appearance before the function - I only learned html so I coudl use js and actully produce things that worked, rather than python which was hard to deploy, and V Basic which is cumbersome and needs office to show anything
