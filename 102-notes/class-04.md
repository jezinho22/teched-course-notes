## Class 04 - HTML
**TIL:**
I have used html before but not realised how useful semantic tags are.
I learned to make an image into a link by putting the img inside an anchor.

My pages will be more readable now and I have already re-written one.
Also never used wireframes before. It is a new idea to be organising the structure and appearance before the function - I only learned html so I coudl use js and actully produce things that worked, rather than python which was hard to deploy, and V Basic which is cumbersome and needs office to show anything.

It is very satisfying.

CSS is like an argos store - you can get to know how to use it quickly but you could spend a lifetime learning everything that's on the catalogue.

I can now structure a page systematically, and navigate the structure in my own and others' pages. I can add formatting to make the appearance appealing, though not yet "just right" which maybe needs more experience of the aesthetics and possibilities as well as the code. I will now look at web pages with a different, more appraising eye - looking for things I didn't realise were possible, looking at colour schemes, looking at structure and usability.

**IWTFO:**
+ More css
+ More about css selectors - to enable more accurate and concise selection
+ More colours
+ How to use flex, so that I have more control and flexibility in positioning elements
